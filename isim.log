    Runs the simulation for the specified time.
    run
        Runs the simulation for 100 units of the current time unit.
        The default time unit is the same as the engine precision
        (resolution limit) and may be changed with the command
        'isim set userunit'.
    run <all | continue>
        Runs the simulation until there are no more events.
    run <time> [<unit>]
        Runs the simulation for the specified time.
        If unit is omitted, the current time unit is used.
        The default time unit is the same as the engine precision
        (resolution limit) and may be changed with the command
        'isim set userunit'.
        Possible values for unit are: fs, ps, ns, us, ms, s.
